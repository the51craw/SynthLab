Knob autamatically sets rotation, you do not have to call SetRotationFromValue().
Do this for all other controls where it makes sense.

Using graphic card, CUDA, is less efficient than using CPU, probably due to the
time it takes to call the dll functions. See if more can be done in one call
rather than many calls.

Add a settings ContentDialog. Move 'Common ADSR' and add 'Common Pitch Envelope' to it.
Add 'Never use graphics card' to settings.

Adapt saving and loading of Patches.

Add buttons for 'factory' patches. Make a hidden AreaButton somewhere to save a
factory patch. Patches should be saved in Local folder:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/files/quickstart-reading-and-writing-files
Remove the hidden AreaButton before publishing the application!

Find all code that is temporary disabled due to the change to multiple layouts and
the use of CompoundControl.

Fix Graph point resizing.

Make Oscilloscope show more, like it did some versions before the last version 
with only twelve oscillators layout.

Make DigitalDisplay show frequencies when setting points in PitchEnvelope.

Implement ADSR FM and PULSE FM for oscillators. This was before a cable connection
from the ADSR to an oscillator input. Now it will be only to FM (maybe also PM?)
since AM is the natural function of the ADSR.

Investigate why Knobs and sliders (all 'move while mousebutton down') sometimes
sticks to a control after mousebutton is released and why clicking a CompoundControl
without hitting a SubControl disables scrollwheel functionality. Clicking any Knob, 
Slider or Joystick enables scrollwheel but also makes the control stick to mouse 
movements, so it must be clicked again. This bug is in UwpControlsLibrary.

PitchEnvelope should effect also modulators.

Add for PitchEnvelope to be controlled by Modulation wheel.

Change key priority to replace first key.

Move all GUI's from Patch to MainPage!

Split up files and put in folders!

Regarding filtering at low frequency that causes crackling noise: In those cases we
get to use very large fftData arrays in order to get a full cycle for the FFT to get
a correct result. However the FFT takes too long time. Try some scheme using FFT on
combed data in order to get the filtered waveform, then use each sample multiple
times to create the final waveform. Try combing out half the samples under key 44,
a fourth of the samples under key 32. If it gets better but not good enough, try
other combings and other keys.

Make sure never to filter LFO oscillators.

Create an extra ramp off frame to use when releasing a key with pulse or release
time = 0, and see to it that it gets generated at key off in the same situation.

Create cables for 3 levels down and for horizontal connections.

Create a settings page with keyboard split.

Bug: If more than one oscillator is active, the one with the shortest release
releases all active oscillators. They should all follow their own adsr. Move
adsr to oscillator.

DX style FM modulation takes too long, even with my class Sine.

Add a 'Are you sure that you want to discard these settings?' question when
changing layout and has made any changes.

Add settings where oscillator output level can depend on keyboard key in order to
raise lower tones. E.g. sine tones needs a large boost in lower range.

Patch should contain only real settings. Those are the GUI's and the different
settings accessible from the control panel. Everything else should not be in Patch.
Create a class for the control panel called ControlPanel.

Removing DX style FM modulator causes crash in oscilloscope.Draw().

Modulations interferes between polys.

=== Issues that are done ===========================================================

In some layouts single GUI's are used. They should be stored in the GUI lists first
element, not in separate objects. Seems to be done already.

See if sample rate can be set to have requested frame size to be 480, or select
an allowed lower sampling rate to get a smaller frame size. Not possible!

ADSR bug: A = 0, D > 0, S = 0, R don't matter => no sound!
          A >= 0, D > 0, S = 0, R don't matter => sound ok!
          NOT a bug! A and D are 0 thus S is used immediatelly.

Using only 1 Pitch Envelope GUI: the GUI is not updated when viewing different
oscillators.

Make DigitalDisplay show initial frequency on startup and patch load.

Implement ADSR mode ADSR FM and PULSE FM, for Keyboard and LFO mode.
Removed, not needed since we have a pitch envelope generator.

=== Remaining issues ===============================================================
=== Above issues apply to old versions and some issues are not relevant due to some
=== more or less massive re-designes. Add new issues here and resolve them.
====================================================================================

* Pitch envelope in layout with four oscillators has the following problem:
    when adding/removing points to pitch envelope 2, also pitch envelope 1
    is changed. When adding/removing points to pitch 1, the points are changed
    to be the same as envelope 2.

* Pitch evelope point coordinates does not follow window size properly. Investigate
    and fix.

* Oscilloscope right end is showing a faulty image.

* Oscilloscope should show a flat line after last key off.

Oscilloscope settings differs between Rotator selection and startup values.

Identify and remove obsolete code.
