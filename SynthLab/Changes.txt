DX style FM synthesis now allows for using different frequency in modulators which allows you to create much more different sounds.
FM modulation can now be selected to cause changes from base frequency up to plus one octave or from down one octave to up one octave.
They synthesizer program code now contains a method that uses much less CPU power. This new method is used with setups that are not too complicated, thus allowing for some synthesis to run on low-end or older computers.
There are more possibilities to combine different modulations, e.g. a DX style modulation can have any AM and FM modulation applied to any of the oscillators involved in the DX style synthesis.
