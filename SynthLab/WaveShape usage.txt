WaveShape is used to pre-create one cycle of a periodic wave.
It is used by the oscillator audio generating algorithm by streaching is into the preferred frequency, the frequency of the pressed key.
A waveform that is complicated to create can be created just once, when an oscillator is re-initilized after pressing a key, and then 
	re-used for all subsequent frames.
However, if the shape of the wave is changing between frames, it has to be re-generated for each new frame, which increases the CPU load,
	especially if filtering is involved.
The oscillator can or have do without using WaveShape in some cases:
	Generating noise.
	Generating random.
	Generating DX style Frequency Modulation synthesis.
	Generating simple waveforms that is not filtered.
WaveShape always does the filtering when filter is in use.

Because of all above we have two conciderations when creating a frame:
Do we need to use WaveFrame at all?
If we do, can we re-use the same WaveFrame for all consecutive frames and just create the WaveShape once?

There are three answers to that:
No, we do not need it.
Yes we need it but only needs to create it once.
Yes we need it and need to re-create it for each frame.

WaveShape responds with an enum for that:
public enum Usage
{
	NONE,
	CREATE_ONCE,
	CREATE_ALWAYS,
}

The Oscillator keeps track of if or when to create a WaveShape, starting at re-initialization 
	(which is called at key on).

The desicions are made in WaveShape.
WaveShape owns the filter.
Each oscillator owns a WaveShape.
